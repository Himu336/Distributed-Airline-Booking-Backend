# ‚úàÔ∏è Distributed Airline Booking System
> A backend-engineered, microservices-driven airline booking system built with a distributed architecture, emphasizing asynchronous communication using RabbitMQ, API Gateway-based routing, ACID-compliant databases, and decoupled service orchestration for high scalability and fault tolerance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Overview
The **Distributed Airline Booking System** is a backend-centric project designed with a strong focus on **scalability**, **modularity**, and **clean service separation**. Inspired by real-world airline operations, it simulates the core backend infrastructure required for managing **flights**, **bookings**, **payments**, and **user operations** at scale.

This repository represents the **centralized entry point** of the system, outlining the overall structure and **orchestration** across multiple backend services.

### üîë Key Highlights (Table Format):

| Feature                               | Description                                                                                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**        | Clear separation of concerns across different domain-driven microservices.                                                                                         |
| **Scalable API Gateway with Authentication**   | Acts as the single entry point for all client interactions, handling routing, request validation, authentication, and rate limiting.                              |
| **Asynchronous Service Orchestration**        | Certain services interact via message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ) to coordinate workflows, reduce tight coupling, and improve resilience in multi-step operations.    |
| **ACID-Compliant Databases**                  | Ensures data consistency, integrity, and reliability across core services like bookings and payments.                                                             |
| **Scalable, Observable Infrastructure**       | Each microservice is designed to scale independently, with integrated observability (logs, metrics, traces) for real-time monitoring and debugging.               |

---

This system is engineered not just to function, but to mimic how **production-grade airline backend systems** are designed to handle **concurrent users**, ensure **high availability**, and provide **robust fault handling**.

## üì¶ Repository and Service Links
This section maps out each core microservice and its corresponding repository.

| Service Name              | Description                            | Repository Link                                                |
